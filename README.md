Part of a tradition amongst my friends is the ability to keep track of our completed games throughout the year and look back upon them later on in the year. THis would normally be done with a simple notebook or word document, but what if there was a way to track not only the games, but also when it was completed and even more details about the game?

The Game completion tracker or Backlog Tracker allows you to enter the information for a game and reference this information later. Currently it only tracks the name, date of completion and genre, with the opportunity to track more info in the future.

Utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Get started: the following link will take you directly to the app which has some information automatically entered. You can then select the option to delete the currently entered information and begin your own list creation

In the future I would like to connect this information to Steam's game & Profile APIs, to allow you to link directly and pull the games information as you complete them, along with all the detailed information listed in the Steam Database.
